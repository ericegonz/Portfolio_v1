  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a hard working individual who is always ready to learn. What motivates me the most is my curiosity.
    This allows me to grasp concepts very easily, especially when it comes to technology.
    I am thrilled to use my technical and marketing background to help a company excel. With great skills in
    software development, troubleshooting & debugging, I thrive in collaborative settings the most.
    I am currently most interested in learning more about the art of Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial
    Intelligence (including CV and natural language processing).

    <br><br>

    On my down time I like riding my bike, flying drones, driving my car and trying new foods.

            I work directly under the Director of Engineering and Director of Software to assist with the analysis,
            design, development, testing and documentation of new and existing software solutions. This includes
            developing new software, making improvements on existing software, and configuring software development
            tools as required by the company.

        <h3>Accelerated Retail Technologies</h3>
        <h4>Software Development Engineering Intern</h4>
        <h5>Corona, CA</h5>
        <p>
            My team and I implemented & deployed major front-end software patch for ~3,800 RugDoctor Walmart kiosks
            running Windows. This update allowed for download of dynamic data from RugDoctor’s SOAP web
            services. Support for insertion of text, prices, images & videos of products on front interface.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, I rebuilt a front-end single page GUI app (HTML5) & JavaScript (AngularJS/Node.js) libraries
            to work with the modern automated retail machine, VICKI (getvicki.com).
            <br><br>
            Also interfaced with Natural Language Recognition services by piping audio to various cloud-based REST APIs
            using Node.js and Python to create an intelligent bandwith-friendly assistant who can answer a variety of
            questions about retail products (i.e. caffeine content, calories).
            <br><br>
            Worked with local SQL databases on kiosks to store & retrieve data required for transactions, products,
            pricing, etc.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, developed & reviewed User Acceptance Tests and executed regression tests relating to them.
